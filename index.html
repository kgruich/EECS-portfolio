<h3>KO Kode: My Custom Game Engine</h3>
<ul>
<li>KO Kode is a 2D multiplatform engine with extensive support for input methods and customization.</li>
<li>The engine is coded in C++, hosts Lua scripting, and utiizes GLM, LuaBridge, Rapidjson, and SDL2 to do so.</li>
<li>Watch a demonstration of the engine <a href="https://youtu.be/CyDq52Zp5SU">here</a>!.</li>

<h3><a href="https://derickson2402.itch.io/legend-of-zelda">The Legend of Zelda (Unity Remaster)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>For the first milestone while creating this Unity remaster, I did a lot of work on the movement and room system. This also included work on player collection UI and locked doors.</li>
<li>For the alpha, I focused on designing the enemy AI for our various NPCs, and laying out the rooms to match the original Zelda.</li>
<li>For the gold build, I designed our custom mechanic: the bouncing fireball weapon and the exploding fireball weapon. This, along with the aiming, and fixing many of the inauthentic parts of our previous build was my focus.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="https://porkako.itch.io/494-p2-tower-defense">A Tower Defense Prototype</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>For the first build of this game, I actually did it all in 3D, but that posed various issues for the generation of chunks, requiring a lot of bespoke tile generation that was beyond my scope.</li>
<li>For the final build, I decided to restart in 2D. This worked out very well, allowing for good looking tilemaps, simple collisions, 2D sprites instead of 3D models, several enemies and towers.</li>
<li>While I had grander ideas and wanted to develop an expanding map, I am satisfied with what I have accomplished in rapidly making a fun tower defense protoype.</li>
</ul>
